# RetroBar Unsupported Systems Reference

This file lists systems that were identified in your ROM collection but don't have direct equivalents in RetroBar.
You may need to handle these systems manually.

## Common Unsupported Systems and Potential Solutions

- Commodore Amiga: Try using "amiga500", "amiga1200", or "amiga4000" based on the specific Amiga model.
- FinalBurn Neo (fba): Use "fbneo" for arcade games.
- PC Engine (tg16): Use "pcengine" for TurboGrafx-16 games.
- Neo Geo CD: Check if RetroBar supports "neogeocd".
- MAME: Use specific MAME versions supported by RetroBar.

## Troubleshooting

If games don't work after moving:
1. Check if BIOS files are required
2. Verify the ROM files are in the correct format
3. Ensure RetroBar is configured to use the correct emulator for that system
4. Check file extensions match what the emulator expects
